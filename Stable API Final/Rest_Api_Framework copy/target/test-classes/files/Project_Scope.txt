9. Define global properties and drive all the global variables from Properties file
10. Define enum class with constants to centralize all resource details
11. Implement data driven mechanism to drive data dynamically from feature file
12. Implement parameterization to run tests with multiple data sets using Cucumber Example Keyword
13. Add more tests and implements Tagging Mechanism to tun selected Tests from Test Runner file
14. Implement Pre- & Post-conditions for tests with Cucumber Hooks
15. Execute complete Framework from Maven Commands
